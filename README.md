# Weather Station Manager
The project presented in this report consists on implementing a service that leverages a **collaborative network of weather stations**, able to collect their data, calculate weather forecasts and display a weather briefing.
The aim of the solution is to **simplify weather systems for local cases**, to **support amateur weather stations** and integration with IoT devices.
The system is separated into four modules: an example station, a weather database, the weather forecast service and the Web server.
The outcome of the developed project is a flexible and scalable service that provides a **seamless interconnection from sensor to web page** with a focus on ergonomics and compatibility.
